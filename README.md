# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
The objective of the case study is to help X Education, a company that markets its courses on several websites and search engines, to improve its lead conversion rate. The current lead conversion rate is 30%, but the company wishes to increase it to around 80%. To achieve this goal, the company wants to identify a set of "Hot Leads" that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The task is to build a model that assigns a lead score to each lead, such that leads with a higher score have a higher conversion chance and leads with a lower score have a lower conversion chance. The ultimate goal is to increase the lead conversion rate by focusing on communicating with the potential leads.
